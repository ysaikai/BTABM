# An agent-based model of insect resistance management and mitigation for Bt maize: A social science perspective
by Yuji Saikai & Paul Mitchell

**Abstract**

It is natural to see insect resistance management as a complex system in which there are spatialtemporal interaction between many biological and social factors. Therefore, we build an agentbased model and conduct simulation experiments to provide insights into the complex system and inform policymakers of potential options. Specifically, we emphasize the significance of social factors, e.g. economic incentives and social network, which have been neglected in the literature. The results suggest that we are in a critical situation where the resistance to Bt crop is about to serge and immediate actions should be taken. In accordance with our intuitions, proactive measures such as refuge requirement and tax are more efficient in terms of economic surplus than reactive ones such as ban and spray.
